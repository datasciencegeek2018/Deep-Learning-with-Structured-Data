# Deep-Learning-with-Structured-Data

### Structured Data has typically not been an area of application for Deep Learning. Domain knowlege is very important but deep learning can reduce the onus on domain knowledge to get good answers rapidly

### In this example, I use a Kaggle dataset to show how entity embeddings for categorical variables can be effectively applied in a structured dataset problem context to get effective results quickly
